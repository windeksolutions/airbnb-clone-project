## Team Roles
Backend Developer
Backend Developers build and maintain the server-side logic that powers the application. They develop API endpoints to support frontend and client-server communication, design and implement database schemas aligned with business needs, write and manage the core business logic and services, and ensure the backend is scalable, secure, and maintainable.

Database Administrator (DBA)
The DBA ensures the database is efficient, secure, and scalable. They design and manage the data storage architecture, implement indexing strategies for performance optimization, monitor, back up, and tune databases to ensure high availability, and enforce data security and compliance standards.

DevOps Engineer
DevOps Engineers bridge the gap between development and operations for smooth delivery pipelines. They automate deployment pipelines for backend services, monitor backend infrastructure and application health, manage cloud resources, containers, and CI/CD workflows, and implement scalability and failover mechanisms.

QA Engineer
QA Engineers ensure the application meets functional and performance standards. They design and execute test cases for backend functionalities, conduct integration, regression, and load testing, identify bugs and collaborate with developers for resolution, and verify that business logic aligns with specifications.



## Technology Stack
Django
A high-level Python web framework that provides the foundation for your application’s server side. In this project, Django handles URL routing, view/controller logic, templating (if needed), and orchestrates the overall request/response lifecycle to expose your RESTful API endpoints.

Django REST Framework (DRF)
An extension to Django that offers powerful, flexible tools to build and manage RESTful APIs. DRF supplies serializers to convert between Django models and JSON, viewsets and routers for concise API endpoint definitions, and built-in authentication/permission classes.

PostgreSQL
A robust, open-source relational database-management system. Here, PostgreSQL stores all persistent data—user records, transactions, logs, and any relational structures—leveraging its SQL capabilities, strong ACID compliance, and advanced features like JSONB fields or full-text search when needed.

GraphQL
An API query language and server specification that lets clients request exactly the data they need. In this project, GraphQL sits alongside (or on top of) Django/DRF to provide a single, flexible endpoint where consumers can efficiently fetch or mutate nested data structures without multiple round-trips.

Celery
A distributed task queue for executing asynchronous or scheduled jobs. You use Celery to offload long-running processes—such as sending bulk emails, processing payments, generating reports, or cleaning up old data—so that these tasks don’t block your HTTP request threads.

Redis
An in-memory data store often used as a cache or message broker. In your setup, Redis powers Celery’s broker backend (queuing tasks) and can also cache frequently accessed database query results, session data, or rate-limiting counters to dramatically speed up response times.

Docker
A containerization platform that packages your application and all its dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. By defining your services (Django app, database, Redis, etc.) in Dockerfiles and a Docker Compose configuration, you ensure that every developer and deployment environment runs an identical stack.

CI/CD Pipelines
Automated workflows—typically built with tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins—that run your test suite, perform linting/validation, build Docker images, and deploy approved changes to staging or production. This automation guarantees fast, reliable, and consistent code delivery while catching errors early
