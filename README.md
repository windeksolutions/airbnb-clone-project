## Team Roles
Backend Developer
Backend Developers build and maintain the server-side logic that powers the application. They develop API endpoints to support frontend and client-server communication, design and implement database schemas aligned with business needs, write and manage the core business logic and services, and ensure the backend is scalable, secure, and maintainable.

Database Administrator (DBA)
The DBA ensures the database is efficient, secure, and scalable. They design and manage the data storage architecture, implement indexing strategies for performance optimization, monitor, back up, and tune databases to ensure high availability, and enforce data security and compliance standards.

DevOps Engineer
DevOps Engineers bridge the gap between development and operations for smooth delivery pipelines. They automate deployment pipelines for backend services, monitor backend infrastructure and application health, manage cloud resources, containers, and CI/CD workflows, and implement scalability and failover mechanisms.

QA Engineer
QA Engineers ensure the application meets functional and performance standards. They design and execute test cases for backend functionalities, conduct integration, regression, and load testing, identify bugs and collaborate with developers for resolution, and verify that business logic aligns with specifications.



## Technology Stack
Django
A high-level Python web framework that provides the foundation for your application’s server side. In this project, Django handles URL routing, view/controller logic, templating (if needed), and orchestrates the overall request/response lifecycle to expose your RESTful API endpoints.

Django REST Framework (DRF)
An extension to Django that offers powerful, flexible tools to build and manage RESTful APIs. DRF supplies serializers to convert between Django models and JSON, viewsets and routers for concise API endpoint definitions, and built-in authentication/permission classes.

PostgreSQL
A robust, open-source relational database-management system. Here, PostgreSQL stores all persistent data—user records, transactions, logs, and any relational structures—leveraging its SQL capabilities, strong ACID compliance, and advanced features like JSONB fields or full-text search when needed.

GraphQL
An API query language and server specification that lets clients request exactly the data they need. In this project, GraphQL sits alongside (or on top of) Django/DRF to provide a single, flexible endpoint where consumers can efficiently fetch or mutate nested data structures without multiple round-trips.

Celery
A distributed task queue for executing asynchronous or scheduled jobs. You use Celery to offload long-running processes—such as sending bulk emails, processing payments, generating reports, or cleaning up old data—so that these tasks don’t block your HTTP request threads.

Redis
An in-memory data store often used as a cache or message broker. In your setup, Redis powers Celery’s broker backend (queuing tasks) and can also cache frequently accessed database query results, session data, or rate-limiting counters to dramatically speed up response times.

Docker
A containerization platform that packages your application and all its dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. By defining your services (Django app, database, Redis, etc.) in Dockerfiles and a Docker Compose configuration, you ensure that every developer and deployment environment runs an identical stack.

CI/CD Pipelines
Automated workflows—typically built with tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins—that run your test suite, perform linting/validation, build Docker images, and deploy approved changes to staging or production. This automation guarantees fast, reliable, and consistent code delivery while catching errors early

## Database Design
Users
id (UUID primary key), name (String), email (String, unique), password_hash (String), created_at (Timestamp)
A user can own multiple properties, make multiple bookings, write multiple reviews, and process multiple payments.

Properties
id (UUID primary key), owner_id (UUID FK → Users.id), title (String), address (String), price_per_night (Decimal)
Each property belongs to one user (the host), can receive many bookings, and can accumulate many reviews.

Bookings
id (UUID primary key), user_id (UUID FK → Users.id), property_id (UUID FK → Properties.id), start_date (Date), end_date (Date), status (Enum: pending/confirmed/cancelled)
A booking is made by one user for one property and results in one or more payments.

Reviews
id (UUID primary key), user_id (UUID FK → Users.id), property_id (UUID FK → Properties.id), rating (Integer 1–5), comment (Text), created_at (Timestamp)
A review is authored by one user about one property.

Payments
id (UUID primary key), booking_id (UUID FK → Bookings.id), user_id (UUID FK → Users.id), amount (Decimal), currency (String), status (Enum: pending/completed/refunded), processed_at (Timestamp)
A payment is tied to one booking and made by one user.

## Feature Breakdown
API Documentation
The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard, ensuring that every endpoint is clearly defined and easy to integrate. Django REST Framework generates a comprehensive RESTful interface for CRUD operations on users and properties, while GraphQL provides a flexible query layer for clients to request exactly the data they need.

User Authentication
Endpoints under /users/ and /users/{user_id}/ allow new users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles. Secure password hashing, token-based authentication, and profile update endpoints ensure that user data remains protected and up to date.

Property Management
Through the /properties/ and /properties/{property_id}/ endpoints, hosts can create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature supports the full lifecycle of a listing, from initial creation and photo uploads to status toggling and removal.

Booking System
The /bookings/ and /bookings/{booking_id}/ endpoints let guests make, update, and manage reservations, including specifying check-in and check-out dates. Booking status transitions (pending, confirmed, cancelled) and date validations ensure a smooth reservation experience for both guests and hosts.

Payment Processing
All payment transactions related to bookings are handled via the /payments/ endpoint. Integration with a payment gateway and transaction status tracking (pending, completed, refunded) guarantee that funds are processed securely and accurately.

Review System
Users can post and manage reviews for properties using the /reviews/ and /reviews/{review_id}/ endpoints. Star ratings and written feedback help future guests make informed decisions, while hosts can view and respond to reviews to improve their listings.

Database Optimizations
Strategic indexing of frequently queried fields accelerates data retrieval for high-traffic endpoints. Caching layers reduce repeated database hits for popular queries, ensuring that the application remains performant even under heavy load.

## API Security
Authentication
All API endpoints will require token-based authentication (e.g. JWT or OAuth2) to verify user identity before granting access. Secure password hashing (bcrypt/Argon2) and multi-factor authentication options will further harden account security.
Why it’s crucial: Ensures that only legitimate users can access or modify sensitive data—protecting personal profiles, bookings, and payment methods from unauthorized use.

Authorization
Role-based access controls (RBAC) will enforce fine-grained permissions: hosts can manage their own properties and bookings, guests can make or view only their own reservations, and admins can perform audit tasks. Endpoints will check user roles on every request.
Why it’s crucial: Prevents privilege escalation and data leaks by ensuring users see and act only on the resources they’re allowed to.

Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data—query parameters, JSON payloads, file uploads—will be rigorously validated against schemas (DRF serializers/GraphQL type checks) and sanitized to strip out malicious content.
Why it’s crucial: Guards against injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, XSS) that could compromise the database or expose customer data.

Rate Limiting & Throttling
API throttles will cap the number of requests per IP or per user token (e.g. 100 requests/minute), with stricter limits on sensitive endpoints (login, password reset).
Why it’s crucial: Mitigates brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints and protects backend services from denial-of-service or abuse.

Transport Security (HTTPS/TLS)
All client–server communications will use HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ enforced, and HSTS headers enabled. Cookies and tokens will be marked Secure and HttpOnly.
Why it’s crucial: Prevents eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and token theft—safeguarding login credentials and payment information in transit.

Data Encryption at Rest
Sensitive fields (password hashes, payment tokens) and backups will be encrypted on disk using AES-256. Database credentials will be stored in a secrets management system.
Why it’s crucial: Protects stored data from unauthorized exposure in the event of a server breach or compromised backup.

CSRF Protection & CORS Policies
State-changing endpoints will require anti-CSRF tokens for browser-based clients, and CORS policies will limit cross-origin access to only approved domains.
Why it’s crucial: Prevents cross-site request forgery and unauthorized JavaScript-based attacks that could hijack user sessions.

Secure Payment Integration
Payments will be processed via a PCI-compliant gateway; the system will never store raw card data. Webhooks and callbacks will be signed and verified.
Why it’s crucial: Ensures the integrity of financial transactions and compliance with industry standards, preventing fraud and financial liability.

Logging, Monitoring & Auditing
All authentication attempts, permission checks, and payment events will be logged with user and timestamp metadata. An intrusion-detection system will alert on suspicious patterns.
Why it’s crucial: Provides visibility into security incidents, enables fast incident response, and supports forensic analysis if a breach occurs.

## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD Pipelines
Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of automatically building and testing every code change as soon as it’s pushed to the repository, ensuring that new commits integrate smoothly with the existing codebase. Continuous Deployment (CD) takes those verified builds and automatically deploys them to staging or production environments. Together, CI/CD pipelines reduce manual toil, catch bugs early, and accelerate feature delivery by making every step—from code commit to live release—repeatable and transparent.

### Why They Matter for This Project

Reliability: Automated tests run on every pull request, so regressions are caught before they reach production.

Speed: New features, bug fixes, and security patches can be shipped rapidly without waiting for manual approval cycles.

Consistency: By codifying build, test, and deployment steps, every environment (local, staging, production) remains in sync, minimizing “it works on my machine” issues.

### Common Tools

GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD: Define workflow files that spin up environments, run tests, build Docker images, and deploy.

Jenkins: A self-hosted automation server with plugins for nearly every CI/CD need.

Docker & Docker Compose: Containerize application components so builds and deployments behave identically across environments.

Kubernetes (or Docker Swarm): Orchestrate containers at scale, enabling rolling updates and self-healing deployments.
